# Caveats and limitations
Please be aware of the following:

## Download data yourself
This repository does NOT contain IOC data and does not manage data acquisition.

  - Data download is not handled internally
  - Examples (in this `README` or in `tests`) use the [`searvey`](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/searvey) package
  - A release of cleaned data through Zenodo is considered (although not planned yet)

## Cleaning is difficult - Examples

In some cases, cleaning is easy and is just about removing spikes
### Spikes

</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for Spikes"
    Remove all spikes selected by copying all timestamps in the `dropped_timestamps: []` array in the JSON file.

    See details on the [JSON structure](reference/json-schema/)

### Noise vs. Physical phenomena

It becomes more difficult when it comes to distinguishing noise (either numerical or physical e.g. boat wakes) from real physical events (like harbour seiches or tsunamis).


#### Physical - Seiches
Here an example of what seems to be a harbour seiche in `LA23` - Lampedusa station (IT):

  src="../seiche.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for Seiches"
    Do nothing

#### Physical - Tsunamis
Here is the 2025 Kamchatka Peninsula Tsunami captured by `cres` - Crescent City station (CA, USA):

  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

#### Physical - Tsunamis (de-tided)
Same tsunami and station, detided:

<iframe
  src="../tsunami_detided.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for Tsunamis"
    Use the selection box to get the tsunami time range and copy it in the `tsunami: []` array in the JSON file.

    See details on the [JSON structure](reference/json-schema/)

#### Noise - Numerical
In some case, numerical noise is easy to isolate like for this station:

<iframe
  src="../example.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for Noise"
    When you're confident about the noise nature, use the selection box to select either time steps or time ranges and paste them in `dropped_date_ranges` or `dropped_timestamps` depending on the case.

    See details on the [JSON structure](reference/json-schema/)

#### Noise - Unknown
In other case, the nature of the noise is difficult to identify. There could be lots of reasons:

 * physical induced noise:
    * wakes from boats passing in the vicinity of the station
    * seiches (or surfbeat) of shorter period than the sampling frequency
    * waves affecting directly the sensor
 * numerical-induced noise
    * station not well calibrated
    * more unknown reasons

##### Example 1
<iframe
  src="../noise.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

##### Example 2
<iframe
  src="../unknown.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for Noise"
    When you're NOT confident about the noise nature, do nothing

### Steps

#### Steps - Short (DST)

Some steps are easy to isolate and deal with. A recurrent error found on tidal stations occurs during DST (Daylight saving time) changes:

  src="../step_simple.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for short steps segments"
    When the step is short, you can use the box select tool to get the time range of the step and paste it in `dropped_date_ranges`.

    See details on the [JSON structure](reference/json-schema/)

#### Steps - Long

Some steps - or offsets - can be caused by mulitple reasons:

  * a sensor change
  * a re-calibration
  * any ohter unkonwn reason

<iframe
  src="../step_long.html"
  width="100%"
  height="710"
  style="border:none;">
</iframe>

!!! tip "Advice for long steps segments"
    When the step is a long - years spanning - segment, select one time step between the break and add it to the `breakpoints: []` array in the JSON file. For the above example we have :
    ```json
    "breakpoints": [
      "2023-07-05T07:47:00"
    ],
    ```

    See details on the [JSON structure](reference/json-schema/)

!!! warning
    We don't provide any fix for steps or offsets in the data.

    The [`ioc_cleanup.clean()`](reference/python-api/#ioc_cleanup.transform) does not demean any part of the signal.

    In the dashboard, we demean signal between breakpoints just for the ease of visualization (more details in `ioc_cleanup._tools`).

### Vertical datum

!!! warning
    Vertical datum are not yet corrected in `ioc_cleanup`.

    It is unclear how local data providers have set-up their sensor calibration and if they all respect local vertical datum conventions.

    A interesting lead would be in using the [PSMSL](https://psmsl.org/) (Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level) data available at least for all GLOSS stations:

### Subjectivity

!!! warning
     * Cleaning decisions are inherently subjective
     * Different operators may disagree on what should be discarded
