# Transformation JSON schema

Each cleaned station is described by a single JSON file that records every
operation applied to the raw signal: the valid data window, dropped ranges and
timestamps, breakpoints, and tsunami events. Because the cleaning is fully
driven by these configs, the whole dataset is reproducible from the raw IOC
data plus the transformations.

## Getting the transformations

- **Zenodo** - the complete dataset includes `transformations.tar.gz` on the
  [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22181274). See
  [Data Access](../access_data.md) for download and extraction steps.
- **GitHub** - the transformations and metadata are also mirrored on the
  [GitHub releases](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ioc_cleanup/releases),
  and live in the `transformations/` directory of the repository.

## Build your own

You are not limited to the shipped configs. To clean a station yourself, write
a JSON file following the schema below and load it with
`C.load_transformation_from_path(...)`. This lets you adjust the valid window,
drop additional bad ranges, or flag events for stations and periods not yet
covered.

```python
import searvey
import ioc_cleanup as C

station = "abed"
df_raw = searvey.fetch_ioc_station(station, "2020-01-01", "2026-01-01")

trans = C.load_transformation_from_path(
    "../transformations/abed_bub.json"
)

df_clean = C.transform(df_raw, trans)
```
